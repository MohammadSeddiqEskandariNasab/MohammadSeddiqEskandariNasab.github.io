This paper explores how soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects can significantly impact the response of structures under seismic loads, a factor often overlooked in traditional structural control. Utilizing the simple adaptive control (SAC) algorithm alongside a magnetorheological (MR) damper, the study analytically examines SSI influences on nonlinear structures. Results are compared with both passive-on and passive-off states. With a prototype structure built from experimental tests, the study establishes a reliable framework by validating the structural model's accuracy. The paper also analyzes control forces, SAC performance in soil-structure systems, and includes a fragility analysis to evaluate structural behavior under various SSI effects.
